\chapter{Organisational Services and Integration}

\section{Abstract}
This brief chapter summarises the execution of multiple new internet services intended for the purpose of providing a reliable medium for not only collaborative services and documentation, but a suitable method by which to store all acquired data in an orderly fashion along with device configuration files.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Problem Definition}

One of the widely benefiting tasks for the wider MUR team is acquiring data.  However, this data is only useful if it is available, so a necessary question desperately requiring an answer is where and how to store this data.  The same is applicable to the device configuration files for the \acrshort{ecu}, \acrshort{adl}, \acrshort{pdm} and \acrshort{plm}.  This data is not only collaboratively used by a multiple sections of MUR, but also ideally required by future teams looking for data to justify new designs.
