  title = {CAE Analyses for Suspension System and Full Vehicle under Durability
	Road Load Conditions},
  year = {2007},
  month = {04},
  abstract = {A CAE approach for suspension system and full vehicle under durability
	road load conditions was conducted based on experiments and simulations.
	Rig and proving ground tests were used to collect road load profile,
	and then served as loading conditions for CAE analyses. For suspension
	analyses, multi-axial road load conditions obtained from rig tests
	were used to further study the stress distribution of suspension
	under road load conditions. Based on the results of stress analyses,
	a fatigue analysis was also conducted to predict the fatigue life
	of the suspension system. The approach combining proving ground tests,
	rig tests and CAE analyses can deliver a timely solution for durability
	analysis in early vehicle design stage with reasonable accuracy.
	Similar approach was also used to investigate the fatigue performance
	of full vehicle. At first, a road load condition was collected. Then
	a full vehicle CAE model was established and correlated with stiffness
	and modal experiments. The correlated vehicle model was used for
	the stress analysis of a vehicle under selected road load conditions.
	Finally, a fatigue analysis was conducted to predict the fatigue
	life of vehicle body. This approach is very usefully for engineers
	to design both the suspension system and vehicle body system during
	early vehicle design stage.},
